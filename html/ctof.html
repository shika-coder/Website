            <p>Celsius, often denoted by the symbol °C, is a widely used unit of temperature measurement in the metric system. <br>
                Named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who introduced the scale in 1742, it has become the standard in many countries around the world.

                The Celsius scale is based on the properties of water, with 0°C defined as the freezing point and 100°C as the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. <br>
                This scale offers a convenient and easily relatable way to express temperature, especially in everyday contexts.
                Celsius is commonly employed in scientific, academic, and daily applications. <br>
                It provides a straightforward and intuitive reference point for understanding temperature variations, <br>
                making it an integral part of weather forecasts, cooking instructions, and discussions about climate and global warming. As a key component of the International System of Units (SI),<br>
                 Celsius plays a crucial role in promoting consistency and clarity in temperature measurement across diverse fields and regions.
